[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/CalcoDev/SFML-Tetris)

A somewhat working clone of the classic game Tetris made in C++ using SFML. This was made in 2 days, and besides the very badly written and structured code and some small glitches in the game, it's working.

Although it isn't great, tt was a great learning experience, and I'm a much better C++ developer now than before. (Trust me on this, I know the code doesn't reflect it >:( )

### Built With

- [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
